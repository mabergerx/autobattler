# autobattler

The idea is to build an autobattler, a-la Hearthstone Battlegrounds, but of course in a simplified way,
which is more geared towards the algorithmic parts of it, rather than the interactivity and the UI.

Specifically, I would like to build the _combat resolve_ part of such battlers to start off with.
